## Getting Started

### Create a New Wallet

1. Install the Nocturne extension from your browser's extension store
2. Click **Create New Wallet**
3. Set a strong password (used to unlock the wallet)
4. **Write down your 24-word recovery phrase** on paper and store it safely — this is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose access
5. Confirm the recovery phrase to complete setup

### Import an Existing Wallet

If you already have a Midnight wallet:

1. Click **Import Wallet**
2. Enter your 24-word recovery phrase
3. Set a new password
4. Your accounts and balances will sync automatically

## Dashboard

The home screen shows your wallet overview at a glance:

- **Total balance** across all token types
- **Token list** — tap any token to see details (balance breakdown, actions)
- **Quick actions** — Send, Receive, and DUST registration
- **Sync status** — indicator showing blockchain sync progress

---

## Sending Tokens

Nocturne uses a multi-step process with zero-knowledge proofs to protect your privacy:

1. Tap **Send** and choose the token type
2. Enter the recipient address (or pick from your Address Book)
3. Enter the amount
4. Review the transaction summary
5. **Build** — the wallet prepares the transaction
6. **Prove** — a zero-knowledge proof is generated (this may take a moment)
7. **Submit** — the proven transaction is sent to the network

You can cancel at any step before submission.

---

## Receiving Tokens

Tap **Receive** to display your wallet addresses. Nocturne supports three address types:

| Address Type | Use Case |
|---|---|
| **Shielded** | Private transactions — balances hidden from public view |
| **Unshielded** | Standard transactions — visible on-chain |
| **DUST** | Receive DUST tokens for gas fees |

Each address comes with a **QR code** for easy sharing.

## Security Best Practices

- **Never share your recovery phrase** with anyone
- **Never enter your recovery phrase** on any website
- **Use a strong, unique password** for your wallet
- **Lock your wallet** when not in use (the wallet auto-locks after inactivity)
- **Verify addresses carefully** before sending transactions
- **Keep your browser and extension updated**

---

## Auto-Lock

For security, Nocturne automatically locks after a period of inactivity. You'll need to enter your password to unlock and resume using the wallet.

## FAQ

**Q: What happens if I lose my password?**
A: You can reinstall the extension and import your wallet using your 24-word recovery phrase. Set a new password during import.

**Q: What happens if I lose my recovery phrase?**
A: Without the recovery phrase, there is no way to recover your wallet. Always keep a secure backup.

**Q: Are my transactions private?**
A: Shielded transactions use zero-knowledge proofs to hide balances and amounts. Unshielded transactions are visible on-chain.

**Q: Why does "Prove" take time?**
A: Zero-knowledge proof generation is computationally intensive. This is what ensures your transaction privacy on the Midnight Network.

**Q: Can I use Nocturne on multiple browsers?**
A: Yes. Import your wallet using the same recovery phrase on each browser. Accounts and balances will sync independently.
